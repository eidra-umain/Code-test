# Food delivery code test

## Functionality

- Present the restaurants fetched from the API in a list.
- When pressing a restaurant card opens up a detail view and show if the restaurant is opened or closed.
- Fetch filters and present them in a horizontal list, pressing a filter item which should alter the restaurant list so it only shows restaurants with that tag. Multiple filters can be selected at the same time.
